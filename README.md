## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests as film buffs and social media cultures. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

## Area of Focus: Literature and Texts

1. What might be considered a digital object or digital representation for your area of focus? You can have multiple examples, but you should explain why you consider it relating to your area of focus (this can be short though). (Gloria)

   In the area of Literature and Texts, digital objects include e-books, online articles, digital archives, and audiobooks, all of which transform traditional print works into accessible and shareable formats. E-books and online journals preserve textual integrity while offering global access, while digital archives ensure the preservation of rare or historical documents. Audiobooks and hypertexts introduce new ways of experiencing literature, expanding the reach and interactivity of literary content.

2. How are digital objects and representations created for your area of focus? What are the processes involved in digitizing these objects? In the African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928) dataset, we learned about the process of digitizing periodicals and Kahle also mentioned a process called OCR, Optical Character Recognition, for extracting text from digitized print materials. What are some of the digitization processes for your area of focus?

   In the area of Literature and Texts, digital objects are created by scanning physical materials like books, manuscripts, and periodicals to produce high-quality images. These are processed using OCR to convert the images into machine-readable text. The digitization process includes manual corrections, metadata tagging (e.g., author, themes), and ensuring accessibility. These steps preserve texts for research while making them searchable and analyzable, essential for studying literature in the digital age.

3. Kahle repeatedly made reference to the Library of Alexandria in his article. What are some historical equivalents to digital objects in your area of focus? How do these historical objects compare to their digital counterparts?(Yunchae C)

   In the article, Kahle compares the ancient Library of Alexandria, whose goal was to gather and preserve the knowledge of a world for universal access, to the modern-day effort of digitization of books, manuscripts, and other literary works. 
In the past, knowledge was stored in tangible forms like manuscripts and scrolls, which were frequently accessible in certain places like libraries or museums and were prone to loss or destruction over time. Due to its fragility, there were few options for preservation and the only method of finding information was by hand reading it. While digital texts overcome these constraints and provide universal access to knowledge from any location with an internet connection, the ability to create multiple digital copies provides better preservation and reduces the dangers associated with technological failure. 
Digital resources, in contrasting with printed texts, allows quick keyword searches, which improves research efficiency and changes the way we engage with literary works. This move to digital media not only makes literary text more accessible but also improve their durability and functionality, which eventually changes hoe we save, exchange, and use knoweldge. 

5. Relatedly, are there examples of born-digital materials for your area of focus? How do these materials compare to digitized objects? For those unfamiliar, born-digital materials are those that were created digitally and never existed in analog or physical form (think most social media, for example). (Francis)

   Looking at different literatures and texts that are born-digital materials, we can look at various texts incorporated in digital-based news, user-generated content, and even digital storytelling. An example of this that comes to mind would be the Oregon Trail. The Oregon Trail is a text based video game that involves decision making and storytelling. You live your life as a 19th century pioneer looking to cross the trail. When it comes to user-generated content, we can also see a lot of digital text based forums. An example of this could be Reddit where users provide text looking to seek responses of other people.

6. What is the oldest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How has this resource been maintained and updated over time? You may also include examples that are no longer maintained or have been abandoned. (DIYA) 

   The oldest digital library is Project Gutenberg, Project Gutenberg was founded in 1971 by the famous American author Micheal S Heart. Project Gutenberg’s goal is to digitize and archive cultural works. Examples are: literature, poetry, music, film, dance, painting, and sculptures. 
Another goal they have is too encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks! Most items in Project Gutenberg are full texts of public domain books. Examples are, Alice In Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, Sherlock Holmes and many more. This library tries to make everything as free as possible for us readers. Most of the books are in english but there are also non english books available as well. You can also read your stories in these certain documents, HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Plucker. Overall Project has been updated over time with their genres of books,languages. As of 2015 Project Gutenberg has added over 50,000 books to their collection and is growing more ever. Currently as of 2024 Project Gutenberg has 70,000 books in their collection.

7. Conversely, what is the newest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How does this resource compare to older digital libraries or archives?(Cindy)

One of the newest digital libraries is the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), launched in 2013. , including images, videos and audio recordings. DPLA's modern interface, advanced search tools, and integration of collections from different institutions provide a more interactive and comprehensive experience than older, text-centric platforms.

7. Are there any examples of your digital object that have gone viral? How did this happen and what impact did it have on the object or the digital library/archive that hosted it?

8. Can you find any examples of free vs. proprietary digital libraries or archives for your area of focus? How do these resources differ in terms of access? (Lucas)

   There are plenty of examples of both free and proprietary digital libraries related to literature and texts. Some examples of free digital libraries are project gutenberg, internet archive, HathiTrust Digital Library, and Google Books. All of these libraries offer a vast collection of free books and offer open access to the public. You can read books and texts online or even download texts for later. Some examples of proprietary digital libraries are JSTOR and ProQuest. Both of these are not free and accessible to anyone, and there are plenty of other sites that also require a membership or subscription in order to gain access to the materials in the database. They differ in terms of access in multiple significant ways. The free libraries are accessible to the public and usually focus on texts that are in the public domain or freely licensed. The users don’t have to worry about paying for access, registering, or affiliation with an institution. On the other hand, proprietary libraries do require a subscription or affiliation with an institution. This limits the availability to only certain and desired users, such as maybe students, professors, researchers, or something else.They usually have access to more recent publications and copyrighted work.
